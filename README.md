## Overview:
Updated ClickEncoder library by 0xPIT so it can be used with STM32. Includes an example which utilises native STM32 timer and a small OLED Display (optional). 

## Hardware:
Successfully tested with:
   - A rotary encoder with a push button
   - Maple Mini board (STM32F103CBT6) and Arduino STM32 core (https://github.com/rogerclarkmelbourne/Arduino_STM32)  
   - SSD1306 128_32 I2C OLED Display and SSD1306_i2c library for STM32 (https://github.com/i998/SSD1306_i2c_STM32)
